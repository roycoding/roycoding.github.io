&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9 Aug 2021&lt;/em&gt; - This is a post on my &lt;a href="https://roycoding.com/blog"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. Get the &lt;a href="https://roycoding.com/blog/rss.xml"&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/747219/128797161-d5c8fb32-e39e-40aa-b454-3ded365c4786.jpg" alt="children-fishing.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hiring-is-hard-and-data-hiring-has-special-challenges"&gt;Hiring is hard and data hiring has special challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently released a book about hiring called &lt;a href="http://dshiring.com"&gt;Hiring Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the questions I've fielded related to my book are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is hiring data roles hard?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What makes DS and MLE hiring specifically difficult?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These questions are at the core of why I wrote my book. Hiring in general is difficult, but hiring for data roles comes with some special challenges. In this post I will lay out my view on why data roles are specifically hard to hire for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hype-and-hope"&gt;Hype and hope&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data science and machine learning have emerged in the last ten years as particularly promising approaches to a number of business problems. Organizations have more access to more data than ever and the hope that business value can be extracted from that data has reached a fever pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hype around data science and machine learning (and something called &amp;quot;artificial intelligence&amp;quot;) has driven all sorts of organizations to build out data teams. The hype has also led a huge number of people to enter the field in the hopes of landing an interesting and highly compensated career (remember the &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century"&gt;sexiest job of the 21st century&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is still the early days of this era of data science and machine learning. While there has been some evolution of roles and titles, the field is extremely broad and there is still a lot of disagreement on what exactly data scientists, machine learning engineers, and related roles actually do. A data scientist at one company may have a very different skill set and set of duties than a data scientist at another company, despite the shared title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hiring-amid-the-hype"&gt;Hiring amid the hype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newness, hype, and lack of clarity create a number of challenges for people trying to hire for these roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that these fields are relatively new means that there are few really experienced data scientists and machine learning engineers, but also there are few people that are really experienced in hiring for these roles. The newness means that the easiest thing to do has been to simply use or adapt hiring strategies from more established roles, such as for software engineering. This creates challenges, as the wrong assessment strategies will lead to more false positives and false negatives in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newness also means that finding those experienced candidates can be very difficult and ultimately very expensive when you do find them, since the supply is so low. Organizations are faced with the fact that experienced talent may simply be outside their budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wide breadth of topics, skills, and technologies that fall under data science and machine learning means that there is often a mismatch between the open role and the candidates. It's often not clear to either side what the other brings to the hiring table, and this can often lead to confusion and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I thought this was a data science role!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lack of alignment and understanding on the basic role definitions is a common source of issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hype has led to a huge influx of people joining the field, leading to a glut of early career people applying for DS and MLE roles. This means that a hiring manager looking to fill more junior level roles is likely to be overwhelmed with the volume of applicants. A team looking to fill both junior level and senior level positions may be faced with two extremely different sourcing problems: too many and too few applicants at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="overcoming-these-challenges"&gt;Overcoming these challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To hire effectively and efficiently, you need to understand these challenges and design a hiring strategy to address them. Core aspects of such a strategy are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding your business needs and determining the specific roles that match.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a job ad that crisply describes the role you are hiring for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding your resources, your constraints, and the market overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing a recruiting, assessment, and interviewing process that's optimized with your resources and constraints in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more in depth on these issues in my book, which is available at &lt;a href="http://dshiring.com"&gt;dshiring.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/body&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://roycoding.com"&gt;Roy Keyes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;14 July 2021&lt;/em&gt; - This is a post on my &lt;a href="https://roycoding.com/blog"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. Get the &lt;a href="https://roycoding.com/blog/rss.xml"&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="i-never-really-set-out-to-write-a-book"&gt;I never really set out to write a book.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a book. A book about hiring. You can buy it at &lt;a href="http://dshiring.com"&gt;dshiring.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2020 we had a global pandemic. Like many people, I was laid off (along with most of my awesome team). Like some people, I decided to try to do something a little different during that time. Somehow I ended up writing a book. This blog post is about that book and how it came into existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When not working in a full-time role (or infrequently, in addition to) I usually take on consulting projects. Earlier in my career those projects where mostly about helping companies implement data science projects, but more recently the projects I've worked on have centered more on strategic decisions related to data-related product and project planning, and more and more often about team planning and hiring strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel with consulting, last summer I also decided to see if I could land on an idea for creating my own software business. Given my experience and interest, one of the more obvious ideas was building software to improve the process for companies hiring data scientists and machine learning practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring for data roles can be difficult. One of the main sources of difficulty is often the shear scale of the problem. Especially when hiring for more junior roles, the number of applicants you need to process can be overwhelming. I was looking for an idea to build something that would help improve that common situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While investigating business ideas and also talking to clients, some of the same themes kept coming up over and over:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you know which roles to hire?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to you find the right people?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you tell who knows what they're doing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you deal with the large volumes of candidates?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, people were willing to pay me to answer these questions, but on the other hand, I was hearing these same questions enough, that it made sense to write them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to write some &lt;em&gt;blog posts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-about-the-book"&gt;What about the book?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial plan was to write some blog posts that I could then send to people who asked me questions about hiring. At the same time, I was struggling to find an product idea that really felt like it would make sense. Two things happened. The first was I came across some advice that the first &amp;quot;product&amp;quot; of your software business need not be actual software, but could be a newsletter, or something else that would help you grow mindshare, while you were working on your software. The other thing was that I saw Joel Grus release his latest book &lt;a href="http://fizzbuzzbook.com"&gt;Ten Essays on FizzBuzz&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike his last book, &lt;a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-from/9781492041122/"&gt;Data Science from Scratch in Python&lt;/a&gt;, he decided to self publish this book on a platform called &lt;a href="https://leanpub.com"&gt;Leanpub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally I thought, &amp;quot;oh, maybe I should just write a book instead of boring old blog posts. How long could it possibly take?&amp;quot;. The reader will of course know that that was one of those fantasies that your brain likes to tell itself sometimes. In reality, instead of a couple months, the book took me closer to eight months to fully complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="self-publishing-in-the-internet-age"&gt;Self publishing in the internet age&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my dad was not much older than I am now, he decided to write a very niche book and self publish it. Needless to say, at that time things were much different. I remember stacks of boxes of his book sitting in the garage for years, as he slowly sold them, eventually giving many copies away to win back valuable space[1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the world works very differently. My main reason to self-publish was because I assumed (I still think correctly) that it would be much quicker and take less effort on my part. Depending on your goals, self publishing today is probably the best choice for most people who have the inclination to write a book. The barrier to entry is lower than it has ever been, just was with most media publishing (video, audio, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up publishing my book via Leanpub, a publishing platform geared primarily towards computing related technical books. Leanpub has very author friendly terms (e.g. 80% of the purchase price goes to the author) and also is geared towards people like myself, who would prefer to write in something simple like Markdown[2]. I'm planning another post detailing the specific workflow I used to write my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self publishing is not without its drawbacks. The royalty structure from a publishing platform like Leanpub is much better than with a traditional publisher, but marketing the book falls almost entirely on the author's shoulders. Somewhere an economist is doing a calculation to find how these scenarios compare, but it's certainly not clear to me how the ultimate expected compensation compares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end you probably shouldn't write a book with the expectation of making a lot of money. I suspect that, overall, I will come out better monetarily than my dad's effort did, though (sorry, Dad!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="im-now-a-published-author"&gt;I'm now a published author&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, sort of. Self published, anyway. But that's fine and my book probably wouldn't exist if I'd decided to try to publish with a traditional publisher, as that sounds like an order of magnitude more effort[3]. I'm not sure I would have gone through with it if I had decided that that was the only &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm glad I wrote this book, as I ended up having a lot of great conversations while making this, including the interviews that I included in the book. It's also been great to hear feedback (and even some appreciation) for the book. I hope I've provided readers with some useful insight and ways to think about the process of hiring data science and machine learning people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't checked my book out yet, please take a look at &lt;a href="http://dshiring.com"&gt;dshiring.com&lt;/a&gt;. And follow me on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/roycoding"&gt;@roycoding&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="footnotes"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On occasion a listing for his long out-of-print book will come up online with an absurdly inflated price due to unrealistic pricing algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leanpub uses it's own version of Markdown called Markua, which is designed for writing books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're nonetheless interested in offering me a publishing contract, my emails are open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
